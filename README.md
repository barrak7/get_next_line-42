# get_next_line-42
Reading a line from a fd is pretty tedious.

A function which returns a new line from a fd every time you call it.

This was my 3rd project in the 42 Cursus.

In this project I had to get familiar with static variables, deepen my knowledge about file systems, and manage memory efficiently.

Debugging was the new skill which I acquired working on this project. And now, debugging is my favourite hobby. I would lighten up if one of my peers asked me to debug his code.
